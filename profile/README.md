## We do not need CMS ðŸ‘‹

Unbody is a content management solution that allows you to use any existing interface, such as Google Drive, Slack, or even just a folder/file on your desktop, as a headless CMS. This means that you can connect your content to your website or apps from wherever you create it, and each update will be instantly reflected on your site.

Unbody enhances and enriches content using cutting-edge technologies like Large Language Models and image processing, making it more accessible and semantic. Its powerful GraphQL API and semantic search engine work with all types of media, including text, image, video, and audio.

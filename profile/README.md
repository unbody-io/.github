# Unbody

**Unbody** is a new kind of development stack engineered for the **AI-native era**. It’s built to seamlessly handle data ingestion, transformation, and enrichment—turning raw, unstructured information into AI-ready knowledge. Unlike traditional approaches, Unbody moves beyond static databases and CRUD APIs, empowering you to build applications where AI isn’t just bolted on, but at the core of everything you do.

## Why Unbody?

### The Old Rules Don’t Apply

Traditional software assumed data lived in tables, accessed through APIs, and presented in a frontend. **AI-native products break this model.** Data isn’t static; it’s alive—requiring continuous enrichment, vectorization, and semantic linking.

### From Rows to Relationships

Old relational structures aren’t enough. AI requires semantic relationships, enabling queries like, “What’s the most relevant document for this idea?” or “What products are similar to this image?” Achieving this with legacy tools is clumsy and inefficient.

### Bridging the AI Gap

AI models speak a different language. They need processed, vectorized, and cleaned data to perform effectively. Unbody provides a pipeline that prepares your data for large language models and vision models—no duct-taping of tools required.

### Beyond CRUD

APIs in an AI-native world must deliver intelligence, not just rows. Unbody’s APIs return semantic matches, generative responses, and recommendations out-of-the-box, freeing you from building complex middleware layers.

## What Is AI-Native?

**AI-Native**: AI is the engine, the foundation of your product. Remove it, and you have nothing.

**AI-Enabled**: AI is an afterthought. Remove it, and the core product still exists—just less fancy.

We believe AI-native is the future. Instead of patchworking AI onto legacy stacks, Unbody unifies AI and product development into one coherent ecosystem.

## One Stack, One Workflow

Instead of juggling multiple tools—LangChain, vector databases, bespoke pipelines—Unbody provides a single, model-agnostic stack. Ingest, process, vectorize, query, and serve data all from one place. Think of it as the MERN or MEAN stack reimagined for the AI-first world.

**How Unbody Stands Out:**

- **Unified Platform**: No cobbling together fragmented tools.  
- **Model-Agnostic**: Use your preferred LLM or vision model.  
- **Semantic APIs**: Query data in a way that’s meaningful to AI models.  
- **Headless Architecture**: Serve multiple frontends from a single backend.  
- **Scalable, AI-Ready Data Pipeline**: Transform raw data into rich, AI-ready knowledge automatically.

## What Can You Build?

With Unbody, the possibilities expand:

- **A Perplexity-like QA system**, but for your company’s internal data.  
- **A Tinder-like discovery experience**, but for your products or content.  
- **A custom Alexa**, trained on your knowledge base.  
- **A smarter internal Wikipedia**, powered by AI-driven semantic search.  
- **A Shazam-like platform for images**, enabling visual similarity and classification.  
- **Your own AI-first CMS**, making content directly AI-queryable.

## Getting Started

**Ready to build the future?** Head over to [Getting Started](https://docs.unbody.io/get-started) to begin.
1. **Set Up Your Project:**  
   - [Setup with Dashboard](https://docs.unbody.io/get-started/step-1-setup/setup-with-dashboard)  
   - [Setup with SDK](https://docs.unbody.io/get-started/step-1-setup/setup-with-sdk)  
2. **Build & Query:** Once configured, you can:  
   - Query your data via GraphQL.  
   - Tap into specialized Image, Video, and Audio APIs.  
   - Connect to LLMs for semantic search, RAG workflows, or conversational interfaces.
